# Exclusives

What console has the strongest lineup of exclusive games?

This list will only consider games that are specifically only on their respective system. Being released on PC bars them from consideration.

### **PS5**

* Demon's Souls
* Ghost of Yotei
* Astro Bot
* *(Upcoming)* Marvel's Wolverine

### **Xbox Series S/X**

* Nothing

### **Nintendo Switch 2**

* Mario Kart World
* Donkey Kong Bananza
* Zelda: Age of Imprisonment
* Kirby Air Riders
* *(Upcoming)* Pokemon Pokopia
* *(Upcoming)* Metroid Prime 4
* *(Upcoming)* Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave
* *(Upcoming)* Splatoon Raiders
* *(Upcoming)* The Duskbloods
* *(Upcoming)* Yoshi & The Mysterious Book

Nintendo Switch 2 easily dominates the competition with their exclusive line-up.

The other two competitors have all but dropped out of making exclusive games entirely, with *Nintendo* being the only one left who values the concept.

## My Opinion

If you value **high-budget single-player experiences**, Nintendo may not be the way to go for you. Their history with 3rd part developer support has always been rocky; there is a high chance that the hot game you want to play will not release on the Switch 2.

If you simply want the most unique and fun experiences, I believe that Nintendo takes the cake. Their lineup of games is unmatched, and you will stand to get a lot of value out of your purchase

For me, I think systems need a strong exclusive lineup in order to sell well, and *Nintendo* dominates here.
