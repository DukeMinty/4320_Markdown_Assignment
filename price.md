*Xbox maintains the lowest entry point with a $400 option for their next-gen system.*

However, that comes with caveats. As a digital-only console, the *Xbox Series S* may prove to be a burden in the long-run if you want to seriously get into gaming.

Not only are you barred from getting resell games, but you are also restricted to a 512GB storage device. That size may not sound bad, but when you take into consideration the current storage demands that games face nowadays *(CoD Black Ops 7 has a total file size of 214 GB)*, many players will not be able to take advantage of that restricted space.

## My Opinion

I think that the most bang for your buck will be found in the PS5/PS5 Slim.

*For $150 extra, you get:*

* 300GB more storage
* A disc drive for resell games
* The same game library as Xbox + Sony-exclusive titles

If you just want a system that lets you play a few nonchalant games with friends, the Series S is the best value, however the PS5 is the best entry point if you want to take the hobby seriously.
