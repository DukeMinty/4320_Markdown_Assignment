The future of any given system is up for speculation.

I would argue that in terms of how long you can expect to be satisfied with your purchase, all systems are viable. The PS5 and Xbox Series S/X are high-end powerhouses that have no restrictions driving people towards upgrading.

Microsoft themselves do not seem very eager to move on from their system. And while Sony is more intrigued at the idea, it stands to reason that the consoles will both be viable choices to buy modern games on for years still to come.

Nintendo Switch 2 however can expect the longest continued lifespan of the three. It will receive constant support and updates throughout its life along with new games to keep playing, whereas its competition have already experienced their golden years.

## My Opinion

I think that there is no real downside to picking up either an Xbox or Playstation today.

These consoles can be expected to remain viable, strong pieces of hardware for the forseeable future. Many people still use their PS4s that released over a decade ago, back when upgrading consoles was a hot button marketing gimmick. Now that the culture of upgrading is slowing down and hardware performance is plateauing, I believe that the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will be reliable for even longer than that.

The future of the Switch 2 looks promising, but is uncertain and comes with many caveats. Just because it is new doesn't mean that it is better.
